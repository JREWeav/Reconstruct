# RECONSTRUCT

## INFO

Reconstruct is my final university project.

It is a granular synth VST that allows the user to upload audio and granulate it with random parameters.

## BUILD INFO

Please note that this does NOT include any JUCE distribution.

It should be built using CMake.

The batch files can be used for building and launching quickly but I would recommend using VSCode's CMake Tools extension or similar.
